Changes to be required
1. getContentt() function : 
    a. output in the function should not be declared as String.
     Its memory expensive. Stringbuilder is preffered/rcommended.
    b. no need to read byte by byte. Can use BufferedReader/RandomFile instead.

2.In SaveContent function :
  a. o.flush() and o.close() is not used.
      The file wont be written properly and completely.

  b. o.write() - writing byte by byte is not recomended.
     We can use BufferedWriter instead.
