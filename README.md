Imagine you're assigned as a developer to this project and you
have to make the first step in refactoring of this `Parser` class.
There are many issues in this class, even though it compiles and works.

Please, submit a pull request with the changes you would recommend to
do here. Try to spend 15 minutes maximum for the entire work. If you
need more time, you're doing something wrong. Remember, you have to
do just the first step in refactoring. Don't fix everything.
